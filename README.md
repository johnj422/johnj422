<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm John Arango</h1>
<h3 align="justify">Entrepreneur, inquisitive, and self-taught, with over ten years of commercial experience in the technology sector. I am currently resuming my career as a Full Stack Developer, looking for new challenges. After working in this industry for so long, I decided to learn how things work, so I began this adventure of programming and developing skills by creating a fully functional Web application that connects to an API and displays information about the details of thousands of Video Games. Another project I worked on with my team is an app that allows people and foundations to list their pets for adoption.</h3>
